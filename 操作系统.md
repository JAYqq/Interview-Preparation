1. 为什么需要操作系统

   如果没有操作系统，那么编写程序就需要去自己开辟内存，并且还要知道内存怎么去定位等等，必须去对不同的硬件调用不同的功能函数，操作系统本质上也是一个程序，这个程序将所有硬件功能函数做了封装，为软件开发提供了接口。系统内核程序开机后一直在内存中，并且这块区域是受保护的

2. 内核和操作系统

   内核是操作系统的核心，内核主要是和硬件打交道，封装了很多与硬件之间交互的接口提供给开发者，而操作系统的范围更大，因为它不仅包括内核，还要做很多像提供界面给用户。

3. 句柄

   举兵通常是一个整数，通过这个数字去标记一些资源，比如在Linux中文件描述符就是一个句柄类型。

## 进程管理

1. 进程和线程的区别

   https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/105086274

   **进程对于操作系统来说就是一个数据结构，拿Linux来讲**

   ```c
   struct task_struct {
       // 进程状态
       long              state;
       // 虚拟内存结构体
       struct mm_struct  *mm;
       // 进程号
       pid_t             pid;
       // 指向父进程的指针
       struct task_struct   *parent;
       // 子进程列表
       struct list_head      children;
       // 存放文件系统信息的指针
       struct fs_struct      *fs;
       // 一个数组，包含该进程打开的文件指针
       struct files_struct   *files;
   };
   ```

   这里面比较重要的是进程号、指向虚拟内存的指针、进程打开的文件指针（结合Linux的文件系统来说），还有上下文数据也就是保存了上一次运行时的数据。

   **操作系统将所有PCB通过双向链表连接起来**（因为进程会经常面临创建和删除的操作）

   Linux下进程的创建是fock()，线程的创建是pthread()，但是两个都是使用了上面这一种数据结构

   进程是操作系统资源分配的基本单位，这些资源主要包括CPU、内存、文件、端口等，进程最大责任就是对这些操作系统分配的资源进行管理，像内存管理，系统中多个进程同时运行，系统就需要对这些进程通过虚拟逻辑地址映射到物理内存上，将不同块内存分别划分给这些进程。正是因为进程拥有更多的资源，所以进程切换的成本会比线程更大。

   线程的话是生存在进程之中，多个线程之间是共享一个进程的资源的，共享资源就意味着冲突的，如果是互斥资源的话，进程就可以对此资源加上互斥锁，如果是允许多个线程共享的资源，那么就涉及到信号量机制，这也是进程对线程的管理

   所以我觉得进程和线程是在操作系统中不同层面的概念，线程在进程中主要关注处理器执行代码的过程，而进程关注的是内部资源的管理和保护。

2. 进程和程序的区别

   - 储存位置不同，程序储存在硬盘上，进程在内存中
   - 程序是静态的，而进程是动态的，它会在就绪、阻塞、执行之间转换

3. 进程的状态

   三种基本状态：

   - 运行状态
   - 就绪    已经获取了全部资源，等待CPU调度
   - 阻塞    还没有获取到所有资源，等待资源的分配

   其他状态

   - 创建状态   正在被创建
   - 结束状态   正在回收资源的状态
   - **挂起**          进程挂起的时候就是把进程从内存放到主存

   **状态队列**

   系统为每个状态下的进程维护了一个队列，当一个进程的状态发生了改变，就会转移对应的PCB

4. 为什么Linux下线程进程创建的更快？

   **copy-on-write** 的策略优化。由于进程中创建的多个线程之间是共享进程资源的，像内存、文件等，对于内存，线程创建的时候不会直接先拷贝内存空间，而是等到线程有写操作的时候才会去复制，所以更快了。

5. 为什么多进程下载更快

   这个直接的原因是窗口大小的问题，而根本原因是TCP的拥塞控制算法的不精准。TCP约束性能主要有流控和拥塞控制，流控主要是参考接受方，跟链路无关，所以主要的原因出在拥塞控制。

   单个线程开启单个TCP链接，在传输数据的时候如果出现丢包，那么就会导致拥塞控制算法会调整窗口大小，然后缓慢增加窗口大小，而这个缓慢增加的过程可以用多线程来避免，因为多个线程可以更快速调整窗口大小，使平均窗口大小会更大。而单线程要占满带宽需要意味着窗口大小要足够大，但是单线程无法保证一直满带宽。

6. 进程调度

   ###  批处理系统

   批处理系统没有太多的用户操作，在该系统中，调度算法目标是保证吞吐量和周转时间（从提交到终止的时间）。

   也就是用户提交了作业以后，就和操作系统不打交道了。

   **1.1 先来先服务 first-come first-serverd（FCFS）**

   非抢占式的调度算法，按照请求的顺序进行调度。

   有利于长作业，但不利于短作业，因为短作业必须一直等待前面的长作业执行完毕才能执行，而长作业又需要执行很长时间，造成了短作业等待时间过长。

   **1.2 短作业优先 shortest job first（SJF）**

   非抢占式的调度算法，按估计运行时间最短的顺序进行调度。

   长作业有可能会饿死，处于一直等待短作业执行完毕的状态。因为如果一直有短作业到来，那么长作业永远得不到调度。

   **1.3 最短剩余时间优先 shortest remaining time next（SRTN）**

   最短作业优先的抢占式版本，按剩余运行时间的顺序进行调度。 当一个新的作业到达时，其整个运行时间与当前进程的剩余时间作比较。如果新的进程需要的时间更少，则挂起当前进程，运行新的进程。否则新的进程等待。

   ### 交互式系统

   交互式系统有大量的用户交互操作，在该系统中调度算法的目标是快速地进行响应。

   **2.1 时间片轮转**

   将所有就绪进程按 FCFS 的原则排成一个队列，每次调度时，把 CPU 时间分配给队首进程，该进程可以执行一个时间片。当时间片用完时，由计时器发出时钟中断，调度程序便停止该进程的执行，并将它送往就绪队列的末尾，同时继续把 CPU 时间分配给队首的进程。

   时间片轮转算法的效率和时间片的大小有很大关系：

   - 因为进程切换都要保存进程的信息并且载入新进程的信息，如果时间片太小，会导致进程切换得太频繁，在进程切换上就会花过多时间。
   - 而如果时间片过长，那么实时性就不能得到保证。

   **2.2 优先级调度**

   为每个进程分配一个优先级，按优先级进行调度。

   为了防止低优先级的进程永远等不到调度，可以随着时间的推移增加等待进程的优先级。

   **2.3 多级反馈队列**

   一个进程需要执行 100 个时间片，如果采用时间片轮转调度算法，那么需要交换 100 次。

   多级队列是为这种需要连续执行多个时间片的进程考虑，它设置了多个队列，每个队列时间片大小都不同，例如 1,2,4,8,..。进程在第一个队列没执行完，就会被移到下一个队列。这种方式下，之前的进程只需要交换 7 次。

   每个队列优先权也不同，最上面的优先权最高。因此只有上一个队列没有进程在排队，才能调度当前队列上的进程。

   可以将这种调度算法看成是时间片轮转调度算法和优先级调度算法的结合。

7. 进程之间的通信

   https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/123377340

   - 匿名管道通信

     1.父进程调用pipe开辟管道,得到两个文件描述符指向管道的两端。

     2.父进程调用fork创建子进程,那么子进程也有两个文件描述符指向同一管道。

     3.父进程关闭管道读端,子进程关闭管道写端。父进程可以往管道里写,子进程可以从管道里读,管道是用环形队列实现的,数据从写端流入从读端流出,这样就实现了进程间通信。

     **缺点**

     只能单向传输、只能父子进程通信。

     **管道出现的四种特殊情况：**

     1.写端关闭，读端不关闭；

     那么管道中剩余的数据都被读取后,再次read会返回0,就像读到文件末尾一样。

     2.写端不关闭，但是也不写数据，读端不关闭；

     此时管道中剩余的数据都被读取之后再次read会被阻塞，直到管道中有数据可读了才重新读取数据并返回；

     3.读端关闭，写端不关闭；

     此时该进程会收到信号SIGPIPE，通常会导致进程异常终止。

     4.读端不关闭，但是也不读取数据，写端不关闭；

     此时当写端被写满之后再次write会阻塞，直到管道中有空位置了才会写入数据并重新返回。

   - 有名管道

     有名管道是一个设备文件，不存在于内核而是存在于用户空间。所以允许任何进程之间通信，只要它们能访问这个设备文件。

   - 信号量

     用来管理临界资源，相当于一个计数器，只支持PV操作

     P(sv)：如果sv的值大于零，就给它减1；如果它的值为零，就挂起该进程的执行等待操作；

     V(sv)：如果有其他进程因等待sv而被挂起，就让它恢复运行，如果没有进程因等待sv而挂起，就给它加1；

   - 共享内存

     **是几种通信方式中效率最高的**，不需要通过内核，只需要在共享内存空间进行数据交换。系统分配两个进程的虚拟内存空间映射到了相同的物理内存空间。

   - 消息队列

     管道通信如果读端不打开，那么写端就会阻塞，所以消息队列解决了这个问题，就是写完数据可以直接可以返回。但是因为这个过程涉及到数据的两次拷贝，所以当数据量比较大的时候就会影响效率。

     另外读进程也可以根据需求进行有选择的读取消息

   - socket通信

     可以实现不同主机之间的通信，像HTTP

8. 中断调用过程

   - 系统将所有中断信号进行编号，这个编号叫做中断向量。中断向量和中断服务程序的对应关系是由中断向量表决定的，系统设置了中断向量和中断描述符的对应关系，中断服务程序由操作系统决定。
   - CPU在执行完每一条指令之后，去确认中断控制器是否有中断请求过来，如果有，CPU就会读取中断请求对应的中断向量，对于异常或者系统调用这样的软中断，中断向量是直接给出的。
   - CPU对照中断向量表拿到对应的中断描述符，中断描述符里面保存了段选择符
   - 然后根据段选择符从GDT（全局描述符）中获取段描述符，，里面保存了中断服务程序的基地址和属性信息。还要检查中断描述符的DPL（特权级），确保中断服务程序的特权级是高于当前程序的（特权级分为0~3,0最高表示内核级别，3最低表示用户态，低级别能够访问高级别），像一些异常系统调用。
   - CPU进行特权级的判断，如果特权级发生变化，就需要切换到中断服务程序运行需要的栈。
   - CPU开始栈保护停止执行的程序的上下文。
   - CPU开始执行中断服务程序的第一条指令
   - 中断服务程序处理完后，将之前程序的上下文出栈恢复程序。

## 线程管理

### 线程的优点

1. 进程中可以创建多个线程并发
2. 线程之间的切换只需要切换一些必要的信息像寄存器、内存
3. 线程之间可以直接通过共享内存实现资源共享

### 线程分类

https://juejin.im/post/5da27254e51d4578282ce26d

- 用户线程

  在用户空间创建线程，通过一个线程库中的函数进行线程的创建，但是这些线程对于内核来说是不可见的，也就是他们都藏在进程中，系统此时还是按照进程来管理。所以，一个进程中的线程只能占用一个核，一个进程中只能同时有一个线程在运行占用CPU，其他线程只能等这个线程释放了CPU才能执行。

  这样明显很减分，一个阻塞，全都要等。所以有一个jacket方案，把一个阻塞的系统调用转换成非阻塞，首先jacket会去确定一下系统调用是否会阻塞，如果会那么就先在应用层阻塞这个线程，把控制权交给其他线程，这样可以尽量让其他非阻塞线程先执行，虽然最后还是会阻塞

- 内核线程

  也就是每次创建线程就进行系统调用，在内核中维护一个线程表（当然还是有进程表存在），可以让内核看见线程

  **优点**

  1. 一个进程的线程可以运行在多个核上，效率更高，充分发挥多核CPU
  2. 不会阻塞，因为此时内核也会对线程进行调度，而不会阻塞在一个线程上。

  **缺点**

  1. 让内核进行线程调度，意味着每次切换都要用户态和内核态的切换。
  2. 线程表在内核中空间是有限的，所以数量级肯定不能和用户级线程相比

## IO模型

IO操作都涉及到两步：系统调用和内核态将数据拷贝到用户态

https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/126286726

**阻塞IO**

调用recev()方法，socket中没有数据就会阻塞在这里，直到有了数据才会接受并返回

**非阻塞IO**

让recev()没有数据就先回到用户态去执行其他操作，等一会再去socket拿数据

**IO复用**

也就是select、poll、epoll，他们三种系统调用本质上也是阻塞IO，他们在recev之前阻塞，socket收到数据后会主动唤醒进程。主要的改进在于他们可以一个进程同时监听多个socket

**信号驱动IO模型**

接受到数据后触发中断服务程序告知程序来收数据，还是同步IO

**异步IO**

内核等数据准备好之后主动将数据拷贝到用户态并通知程序，这时候程序只需要直接去操作数据就可以。

**所以异步IO和同步IO主要区别在第二步也就是拷贝数据，同步IO的阻塞都是发生在这里。**



## 内存管理

https://blog.csdn.net/wang379275614/article/details/13765599

### 页式管理

逻辑空间分页，物理空间分块

页地址分为页号和位移量，位移量表示页的大小

![](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20131031074850828?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQvd2FuZzM3OTI3NTYxNA==/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/400/fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/gravity/Center)

根据页表去找到对应块号，根据块号找到对应内存块，然后在块内移动位移量找到指定内存初始地址



### 段式管理

逻辑地址=段号+段内地址

物理地址=基址+块内地址

根据段表去判别段号对应的基址

![](https://img-blog.csdn.net/20131031091123328?watermark/2/text/aHR0cDovL2Jsb2cuY3Nkbi5uZXQvd2FuZzM3OTI3NTYxNA==/font/5a6L5L2T/fontsize/400/fill/I0JBQkFCMA==/dissolve/70/gravity/SouthEast)

内存空间中的每一段都是连续有完整逻辑意义的分区。

### 分段和分页的区别

分页时，页的大小是固定的根据页面大小将程序切开，而分段是根据程序来，将一段完整意义的程序切开（像一个函数）





  Chapter 25 - Day 7, Family  "Ah ~ I want to take a leave of absence.” Su-yeon came out after the test and  stretched. Was it better than the ‘I want to commit suicide’ they’d muttered  when studying for the test?  Dong-wook looked around at all of us and said meaningfully, "Everybody has  suffered, so let’s meet again for the re-test.”  “Don’t say such unlucky things!” Su-yeon huffed angrily and Dong-wook just  chuckled before looking at me.  "But Hee-chul, did you solve the problems?”  “Yes. Why?"  "I saw you during the middle of the test. You were leaning back in your chair  and turning your pen.”  Ah, that. "I have a lot to think about these days.”  "You were thinking during the test?” The gazes of the two people turned towards  me.  Whoops. I added an excuse. "But I was checking over the problems. There was  still time left after.”  “...”  “...” Their expressions became more pronounced.  “... Oppa.”  “Huh?”  "I just want to say that Oppa is like a character who appeared from a drama.”  "A very unfortunate guy. I feel like you are the type of snobby person who will  raise your index finger to fix your glasses.” Dong-wook assisted Su-yeon in  teasing me and he hit my shoulder while laughing.  "Your attempt wasn’t bad, but you should put more effort into acting. Hey. It is  creepy, not funny.” I couldn’t help but laugh and then stayed silent while  Su-yeon and Dong-wook talked about the test.  "But it was really difficult. Today’s test.”  "Well. Let’s see... I don’t know if there will be anybody who exceeds 40 points.  I skipped problem number seven.”  "I missed seven and nine...” I was satisfied with the result. I hadn’t realized  it was difficult at all. As I told Dong-wook, I finished the test with  approximately 1/3rd of the time left. Concentration helped, but the biggest  factor was Mental Image.  Drawing out notes in my brain was faster than using my hands and I could see it  clearly. Thanks to that, I was able to sort out my thoughts several times faster  than usual. "Anyway, now the hard work is over so we should party. Shall we go  to P-X?”  “Let’s do it!”  "I already have a prior engagement.” I pointed to the student cafeteria. "I’m  eating lunch with someone.”  “Huh? Who?”  I thought for a moment before picking the appropriate answer. "Just a friend I  know.”  &  Just a friend I know. She was easy to find, and I couldn’t help but laugh as  soon as I saw her.  She was occupying a place in the crowded student cafeteria without a plate in  front of her. The people around her were glaring, but she couldn’t see because  her head was bowed. It was more like she had no idea rather than being  shameless.  “Excuse me.”  "H-H-Hello...”  "Let’s go outside. We shouldn’t interfere with the people wanting to sit.”  “...Ah.” I took her to a corner of the campus. It was a cafe in a graduate  school research centre. There was no one eating lunch here.  “Now, tell me.”  "I-I can give you money.”  “And?” I raised an eyebrow. Was that all? Of course, the easiest method of give  and take was through money. "How much and in what manner will you give it to  me?”  “...” Had she not thought about this? Of course, I didn’t intend to receive just  a few pennies.  It wouldn’t be an issue if it was just lending money between friends. Frankly, I  didn’t know a lot about huge donations. I lived alone and never received any  unearned income. I knew that ordinary people like me were scared to receive  large amounts of money without any cost. However, that answer was taken care of  when the other person was the child of a big company.  "Can’t you just blindly give me money? First of all, can I get 100 million in  cash now?”  “N-Not right now...” I stood up. Indeed, I was also naive. Was it due to the  fantasy of a chaebol? (chaebol= type of family run business conglomerate)  The rumours about Yoon Ji-hee weren’t that good. Her skills weren’t good enough  to go to the best university in Korea or to study overseas-- so she bought her  way into our private university through the method known as ‘rich selection.’  Still, I thought she would study and have a certain amount of intelligence. I  didn’t think she would be this stupid. "I’ll see you at midnight.” It wasn’t a  threat, it was just an end to the conversation. I would take it as she had no  influence within her family.  Her answer was quick. "W-wait a minute."  Deopsseok.  Yoon Ji-hee’s hand grabbed my wrist, though without much force. We were  currently in reality, not the dungeon. I no longer had any business with her  here. "I need to talk to my mother.”  “...” She still listened to her mother?  "Are you one of those people whose mother checks on them every night?”  "S-She knows.”  “What?  "My mother knows. And Grandfather...” I turned back to Yoon Ji-hee.  "Are they also inside the dungeon?”  "Nope. That isn’t it... Yesterday, my grandfather called all his grandchildren  together...” Someone who had reached the 5th day in the dungeon had reported all  of it to her grandfather. It wasn’t difficult to prove it. They had held on for  five days, so they would either have an item or an excellent talent.  Yoon Sang-gyu, the currently head of the UZ Group, collected all his  grandchildren and their parents, and gave them the edict: ‘It doesn’t matter  what you do in there. The next leader of the UZ Group will be handed over to the  last person who remains.’  “So, how many people are there?”  "Five people including me...”  “Will you take out the other four to become chairman of the group?”  "I-I hadn’t thought about it specifically. But... It doesn’t seem to be a big  deal since they won’t die... So my mother..." No, I guessed that it was already  a big deal in her house. My mind was reeling the moment I heard the situation.  I thought I had caught a tuna with my fishing rod, only to find a whale  underneath. The scale was much larger than I thought. Instead of leaving the  cafe, I ordered a sandwich from the counter.  "I'll buy it for you...”  “It’s done. Just eat.” I filled my empty stomach and continued to question her.  "How many of them didn’t enter the dungeon?”  “Just one. He was born late so he is only five years old...” A chaebol was  definitely different. Five of the six grandchildren had entered the dungeon.  From one perspective, the UZ Group wasn’t a big deal. The fact that Yoon Ji-hee  was in front of me proved that.  Of course, if one of them completed the dungeon then the next UZ chairman would  be a superhuman. But what if they didn’t clear it? Except for the five year old  who wasn’t grown yet, the next chairman might be someone with no desires.  "If I go to Mother then she might do something. I don’t know... The way that my  uncle is treating the others...”  “The others?”  “Ah... I met my cousin on the fifth floor. I heard that he recruited real people  in reality.” No, this story was none of my business. Yoon Ji-hee was obviously  used as a bait on the 6th floor.  “What happened?”  "I-I hadn’t thought about it until the fifth floor. My other cousins are also  meeting and gathering people in real life.”  “...”  "I couldn’t trust them so I went down to the 6th floor alone. Then I met you  and... You said I would die if I lied...”  “...” Looking at this, who would believe that she was a chaebol? I drank the  soda that came with the sandwich. It was a cup full of carbonated juice, but I  was still thirsty. Yang Su-jin’s words were correct--this was ‘real.’ She was  just an ordinary girl, not a member of a chaebol.  She was someone whose siblings and cousins wouldn’t have wanted on the same  team. Still, the chaebols had taken advantage of their power.   I had received one unwelcome piece of information: there was a combination of  top players in the dungeon. At least four of them were tied together by money  and power in reality.  The UZ Group wasn’t the only chaebol. Also, chaebols weren’t the only ones who  could mobilize money and power. I rubbed my temples with both hands. I couldn’t  say anything else as Yoon Ji-hee stared at me with a worried expression.  Then the cafe door opened and I heard a shaky sound. Hup. Yoon Ji-hee sucked in  her breath. Many footsteps entered the cafe, and the voice of a female was  heard. “Unni! You were here!”  “Sang-ah...” I didn’t turn around. The amazed expression on Yoon Ji-hee’s face  told me roughly who the owners of the footsteps behind me were. “S-Sang-min  oppa... What brings you here...?”  “Didn’t Grandfather say that we didn’t need to go to school or work for a while?  I was just going for a long drive. Then I saw Unni here.” This wasn’t a crowded  place--it was a cafe on a corner of the campus. It was impossible to just ‘pass  by’ the building.   They must have followed Yoon Ji-hee here, or perhaps they were using direct  surveillance. It was only natural to keep an eye on their competitors. “Who is  this? Can we join you?”  "That... Right now, we are having an important discussion...”  “Ah! Someone you met in the dungeon?” The female clapped her hands. The male,  Sang-min, still hadn’t talked. I just chewed on the rest of my sandwich.  "Unni is trying to make a contract... But what are you going to offer for the  contract? I heard that you don’t have a lot of money these days. Grandfather  also won’t give you any.”  The voice was sufficient to determine that Yoon Ji-hee was the female’s meal.  "Well, I am going first. I’ll see you later.” I said to Yoon Ji-hee and got up.  As I turned around, I saw the faces of a male and female.  Yoon Sang-ah was approximately 20 years old. Yoon Sang-min was a man in his late  20’s. I could tell they were siblings with one glance. Behind them, there were  people glancing this way.  They didn’t seem to be bodyguards. They were all wearing plain clothes. There  was a variety of men and women of different ages. I memorized those faces. It  was unlikely that I would only see them again in reality.  "Hello!" Yoon Sang-ah bowed and greeted me. “Are you a student of this school?  What is your name?”  "It is a little difficult to tell you.” I spoke as politely as possible. Even if  they didn’t follow me after this, it was hard to confront a chaebol. Instead, I  tried to go straight to the exit.  "If you haven’t formed an agreement yet, come here. I can offer you 100% more  than what Unni did.”  “I will think about it.”  "Is there any need to think? You won’t receive this offer again.” Yoon Sang-ah  blocked my path.  "We have a company. It is like an affiliate. If you accept then I can hire you  within an hour. You will receive a ‘salary’ without needing to go to work.”  Certainly, it was 100 times better than her cousin’s offer. "You don’t have to  do a lot. When you go to the next floor, just take Ji-hee unni out.”  "W-What does that mean?!” Yoon Ji-hee exclaimed but Yoon Sang-ah just laughed.  “Why? Isn’t it an efficient method? Unni tried to buy this person so the answer  is simple.” Her expression changed with the next words. "Unni is already stupid,  so is it a bad thing?”  “Euh...” Well. This was one thing I agreed with, so I had nothing to say. I  raised my hand and brought it to Yoon Sang-ah’s shoulder. "If you are finished,  then please let me pass. This is the testing period.”  “... Didn’t you understand my offer? I can repeat it again.”  "No. I understood.”   She didn’t seem to care about how much Yoon Sang-ah ‘offered.’ I raised one  finger. “One billion.”  "What?"  "By today. Can you ensure that I receive one billion won legally and without  looking suspicious?” I could tell just by looking at her facial expression-- she  looked at me like I was crazy. The problem wasn’t just the amount.  It didn’t matter. "It is no use if you can’t afford that.” I slowly pushed Yoon  Sang-ah out of the way.   “There is nothing to talk about.”  If you find any errors ( broken links, non-standard content, etc.. ), Please let  us know < report chapter > so we can fix it as soon as possible.
